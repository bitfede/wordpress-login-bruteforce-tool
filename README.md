#Wordpress bruteforce tool in Python

This is a simple security script/tool that allows you to test the strength of a wordpress login.

It defaults to a `word.txt` file to try all passwords, but you can provide your own .txt list.

I built this for solving the web3 challenge of the 2018 ShariCTF8 cybersecurity tournament.
